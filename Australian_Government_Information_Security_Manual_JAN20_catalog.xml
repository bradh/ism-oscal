                    <p>Taking immediate remediation steps after the discovery of malicious code can minimise the time and cost spent eradicating and recovering from the infection. As a priority, all infected systems and media should be isolated to prevent the infection from spreading further. Once isolated, infected systems and media can be scanned by antivirus software to potentially remove the infection. It is important to note though, a complete system restoration from a known good backup or rebuild may be the only reliable way to ensure that malicious code can be truly eradicated.</p>

In addition, a cyber security strategy may also cover an organisation's threat environment, cyber security initiatives (an action plan) or investments the organisation plans to make as part of its cyber security program. Without a cyber security strategy, organisations risk failing to adequately plan for and manage security and business risks within their organisation.</p>

                    <ul>

                    <p>If none of the above approaches are feasible, organisation may wish to minimise the potential impact of not securing ICT equipment when not in use. This can be achieved by preventing sensitive or classified information from being stored on hard drives (e.g. by storing user profiles and documents on network shares), removing temporary user data at logoff, scrubbing virtual memory at shut down, and sanitising memory at shut down. It should be noted though that there is no guarantee that such measures will always work effectively or will not be bypassed due to circumstances such as an unexpected loss of power. Therefore, hard drives in such cases will retain their sensitivity or classification for the purposes of reuse, reclassification, declassification, sanitisation, destruction and disposal.</p>

                    <p>Many RF devices, such as mobile devices, can pose a security risk to organisations when they are capable of picking up and recording or transmitting background conversations. In highly classified environments, it is important that organisations understand the security risks associated with the introduction of RF devices and should maintain a register of those that have been authorised for use in such environments.</p>

                    <p>While there have been a number of revisions to the Bluetooth protocol that have made incremental improvements to its security over time, there have also been trade-offs that have limited these improvements, such as maintaining backward compatibility with earlier versions of the protocol. While newer versions of the Bluetooth protocol have addressed many of its historical weaknesses, it still provides inadequate security for the communication of sensitive or classified information. As such, sensitive or classification information communicated using Bluetooth will need to be limited to within RF screened buildings.</p>

                    <p>In certain circumstances it may not be possible to use the correct cable colours. Under these circumstances organisations are to band cables with the appropriate colour. The banding of cables is to comply with the inspection points for the cables. The size of the cable bands should be easily visible from the inspection point. For large bundles on cable reticulation systems, band and label the entire bundle. It is important bands are robust and stand the test of time. Examples of appropriate cable bands include stick-on coloured labels, colour heat shrink, coloured ferrules or short lengths of banded conduit.</p>

                    <p>As mobile devices used outside the office will be carried through areas not authorised to process the information stored on them, carrying them in a secured state (i.e. encryption is active when they are not in use) will decrease the likelihood of accidental or deliberate compromise of information. Depending on the type of mobile device, the effectiveness of encrypting its internal storage might be reduced if the device is lost or stolen while it is in sleep mode or powered on with a locked screen.</p>

While this functionality was designed with a legitimate purpose in mind (e.g. such as automatically loading a graphical user interface for a user to browse the contents of media or to install software residing on the media) it can also be used for malicious purposes. For example, an adversary can create a file on media that the operating system believes it should automatically execute. When the operating system executes the file, it can have the same effect as when a user explicitly executes malicious code; however, in this case the user is taken out of the equation as the operating system executes the file without explicitly asking for permission.</p>

Media can also be prevented from connecting to systems by disabling connection ports in software or by physical means such as using wafer seals or applying epoxy. If physical means are used to prevent media connecting to systems, processes and procedures covering detection and reporting are needed in order to respond to attempts to bypass these security controls.</p>

                    <p>Published literature suggests that short-term remanence effects are likely in volatile media. Data retention times have been reported to be measured in minutes at normal room temperatures and up to hours in extreme cold. Furthermore, some volatile media can suffer from long-term remanence effects resulting from physical changes to the media due to continuous storage of static data for an extended period of time. It is for these reasons that under certain circumstances TOP SECRET volatile media retains its classification following sanitisation.</p>

                    <p>Typical circumstances preventing the reclassification of TOP SECRET volatile media include a static cryptographic key being stored in the same memory location during every boot of a device and a static image being displayed on a device and stored in volatile media for a period of months.</p>

                    <p>Both the host-protected area and device configuration overlay table of non-volatile magnetic media are normally not visible to an operating system or a computer’s basic input/output system. Therefore, any sanitisation of the readable sectors of media will not overwrite these hidden sectors leaving any data contained in these locations untouched. Some sanitisation programs include the ability to reset media to their default state removing any host-protected areas or device configuration overlays. This allows the sanitisation program to see the entire contents of media during the subsequent sanitisation process.</p>

                    <p>Modern non-volatile magnetic media automatically reallocates space for bad sectors at a hardware level. These bad sectors are maintained in what is known as the growth defects table or ‘g-list’. If data was stored in a sector that was subsequently added to the g-list, sanitising the media will not overwrite these non-addressable bad sectors. While these sectors may be considered bad by the media, quite often this is due to the sectors no longer meeting expected performance norms and not due to an inability to read/write to them. The Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) secure erase command was built into the firmware of post-2001 media and is able to access sectors that have been added to the g-list.</p>

                    <p>Many endpoint security solutions rely on signatures to detect malicious code. This approach is only effective when a particular piece of malicious code has already been profiled and signatures are current. Unfortunately, an adversary can create variants of known malicious code, or develop new unseen malicious code, to bypass traditional signature-based detection mechanisms. A Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) can use behaviour-based detection schemes to assist in identifying and blocking anomalous behaviour, such as process injection, keystroke logging, driver loading and call hooking, as well as detecting malicious code that has yet to be identified by antivirus vendors.</p>

Many forms of malicious code are designed specifically to take advantage of this by using common protocols such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and DNS. Software firewalls are more effective than network firewalls as they can control which applications and services can communicate to and from workstations and servers.

                    <p>Microsoft Office files can contain embedded code (known as a macro) written in the Visual Basic for Applications programming language. A macro can contain a series of commands that can be coded or recorded, and replayed at a later time to automate repetitive tasks. Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by users to greatly improve their productivity. However, an adversary can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting to compromise workstations in order to exfiltrate or deny access to sensitive or classified information. To reduce this security risk, organisations should disable or secure their use of Microsoft Office macros.</p>

                    <p>Privileged users, positions of trust, users of remote access solutions and users with access to important data repositories are more likely to be targeted by an adversary due to their level of access.

                    <p>When implementing multi-factor authentication, a number of different authentication factors can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors such as those sent via Short Message Service are more susceptible to compromise by an adversary than others. For this reason, a limited number of authentication factors are recommended for use as part of multi-factor authentication implementations.</p>

                    <p>The benefit of implementing multi-factor authentication can be diminished when credentials are reused on other systems. For example, when usernames and passwords used as part of multi-factor authentication for remote access are the same as those used for corporate workstations. In such circumstances, if an adversary had compromised the device used for remote access, they could capture the username and password for reuse against a corporate workstation that did not require the use of multi-factor authentication.</p>

                    <p>A significant threat to the compromise of user accounts is offline password/passphrase cracking tools. When an adversary gains access to a list of usernames and hashed passwords/passphrases from a system, they can attempt to recover them by comparing the hash of a known password/passphrase with the hashes from the list of hashed passwords/passphrases that they obtained. By finding a match, an adversary will know the password/passphrase associated with a given username. Combined, this often forms a complete set of credentials for an account.</p>

                <part name="guidance">
                    <p>In order to reduce this security risk, organisations should implement multi-factor authentication. Note, while single-factor authentication is no longer considered suitable for protecting sensitive or classified information, it may not be possible to implement on some systems. In such cases, organisations will need to increase the time on average it takes an adversary to compromise a password/passphrase by introducing complexity and continuing to increase its length over time. Such increases in length can be balanced against useability through the use of passphrases rather than passwords. In cases where systems don’t support passphrases, and as an absolute last resort, the strongest password length and complexity supported by a system will need to be implemented.</p>

                    <p>Once a patch is released by a vendor, and the associated security vulnerability has been assessed for its applicability and importance, the patch should be deployed in a timeframe that is commensurate with the security risk. Doing so ensures that resources are spent in an effective and efficient manner by focusing effort on the most significant security risks first.</p>

If a patch for high assurance ICT equipment is approved for deployment, the ACSC will inform organisations of the timeframe in which the patch is to be deployed.</p>

Temporary workarounds may include disabling the vulnerable functionality within the operating system, application or device, or restricting or blocking access to the vulnerable service using firewalls or other access controls. The decision as to whether a temporary workaround is implemented should be risk-based, as with patching.</p>

                    <p>DBMS software is also often capable of accessing files that it has read access to on the database server. For example, an adversary using an SQL injection could use the command LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ‘etc/passwd’ INTO TABLE Users or SELECT load_file(“/etc/passwd”) to access the contents of a Linux password file. Disabling the ability of the DBMS software to read local files from a server will prevent such SQL injection from succeeding. This could be performed, for example, by disabling use of the LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE command.</p>

                    <p>Undeliverable or bounce emails are commonly sent by receiving email servers when an email cannot be delivered, usually because the destination address is invalid. Due to the common spamming practice of spoofing sender addresses, this often results in a large amount of bounce emails being sent to an innocent third party. Sending bounces only to senders that can be verified via SPF, or other trusted means, avoids contributing to this problem and allows trusted parties to receive legitimate bounce messages.</p>

As such, disabling IPv6 functionality until it is intended to be used will minimise the attack surface of the network and ensure that any IPv6 functionality that is not intended to be used cannot be exploited.</p>

                    <p>To aid in the transition from Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) to IPv6, numerous tunnelling protocols have been developed that are designed to allow interoperability between the protocols. Disabling IPv6 tunnelling protocols on network devices and ICT equipment that do not explicitly require such functionality will prevent an adversary bypassing traditional network defences by encapsulating IPv6 data inside IPv4 packets.</p>

SLAAC reduces the ability of an organisation to maintain effective logs of IP address assignment on a network. For this reason, stateless IP addressing should be avoided.</p>

                <part name="guidance">
                    <p>A method commonly recommended to lower the profile of a wireless network is disabling SSID broadcasting. While this ensures that the existence of the wireless networks is not broadcast overtly using beacon frames, the SSID is still broadcast in probe requests, probe responses, association requests and re-association requests. As such, it is easy to determine the SSID of the wireless network by capturing these requests and responses. By disabling SSID broadcasting, organisations will make it more difficult for users to connect to a wireless network. Furthermore, an adversary could configure a malicious wireless access point to broadcast the same SSID as the hidden SSID used by a legitimate wireless network, thereby fooling users or devices into automatically connecting to the adversary’s malicious wireless access point instead. In doing so, the adversary could steal authentication credentials in order to gain access to the legitimate wireless network. For these reasons, it is recommended organisations enable SSID broadcasting.</p>

                    <p>When an organisation chooses to deploy a wireless network, a number of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods that are supported by the Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) protocol can be chosen. These EAP methods include WPA2-Enterprise with Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS), WPA2-Enterprise with Extensible Authentication Protocol-Tunnelled Transport Layer Security or WPA2-Enterprise with Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol.</p>

Furthermore, due to its inclusion in the initial release of the WPA2 standard, it enjoys wide support in wireless access points and operating systems. EAP-TLS uses a public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server through the use of x.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides strong mutual authentication, it requires an organisation to have established a PKI. This involves deploying their own certificate authority and issuing certificates, or purchasing certificates from a commercial certificate authority, for every device that accesses the wireless network. While this introduces additional costs and management overheads, the security advantages are significant.</p>

                    <p>When issuing a certificate to a device in order to access a wireless network, organisations should be aware that it could be stolen by malicious code.

                    <p>When issuing a certificate to a user in order to access a wireless network, it can be in the form of a certificate that is stored on a device or a certificate that is stored within a smart card. Issuing certificates on smart cards provides increased security, but at a higher cost. Specifically, a user is more likely to notice a missing smart card and alert their security team, who are then able to revoke the credentials on the RADIUS server, which can minimise the time an adversary has access to the wireless network. In addition, to reduce the likelihood of a stolen smart card from being used to gain unauthorised access to a wireless network, two-factor authentication can be implemented through the use of personal identification numbers (PINs) on smart cards. This is particularly important when a smart card grants a user any form of administrative access.</p>

                    <p>When 802.1X authentication is used, a shared secret key known as the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) is generated. Upon successful authentication of a device, the PMK is capable of being cached to assist with fast roaming between wireless access points. When a device roams away from a wireless access point that it has authenticated to, it will not need to perform a full re-authentication should it roam back while the cached PMK remains valid. To further assist with roaming, wireless access points can be configured to pre-authenticate a device to other neighbouring wireless access points that the device might roam to. Although requiring full authentication for a device each time it roams between wireless access points is ideal, organisations can choose to use PMK caching and pre-authentication if they have a business requirement for fast roaming. If PMK caching is used, the PMK caching period should not be set to greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours).</p>

Sufficiently separating wireless networks through the use of frequency separation can help reduce this security risk. This can be achieved by using wireless networks that are configured to operate on channels that minimise overlapping frequencies or by using both 802.11b/g (2.4 GHz) channels and 802.11n (5 GHz) channels. It is important to note though, if implementing a mix of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels, not all devices may be compatible with 802.11n and able to connect to 5 GHz channels.</p>

                        <li>using multiple computers to direct a large volume of unwanted network traffic at online services in an attempt to consume all available network bandwidth</li>
                        <li>using multiple computers to direct tailored traffic at online services in an attempt to consume the processing resources of online services</li>
                        <li>hijacking online services in an attempt to redirect legitimate users away from those services to other services that the adversary controls.</li>
                    </ul>

                <part name="guidance">
                    <p>Although an organisation cannot avoid being targeted by denial-of-service attacks, there are a number of measures they can implement to prepare for and potentially reduce the impact if targeted. Preparing for denial-of-service attacks before they occur is by far the best strategy, it is very difficult to respond once they begin and efforts at this stage are unlikely to be effective.</p>

                    <p>When organisations use encryption for data at rest, or data in transit, they are not reducing the sensitivity or classification of information. However, as the information is encrypted, the consequences of the encrypted information being accessed by an adversary is considered to be less. Therefore, physical storage and handling requirements applied to the encrypted information can be reduced. As the sensitivity or classification of the unencrypted information does not change, additional layers of encryption cannot be used to further lower physical and handling requirements.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 is a United States standard for the validation of both hardware and software cryptographic modules. FIPS 140 is in its second iteration and is formally referred to as FIPS 140-2. These guidelines refer to the standard as FIPS 140, but it applies equally to FIPS 140-1, FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3, which had been released in draft but has since been abandoned.</p>

                    <p>FIPS 140 is not a substitute for an ACE as it is concerned solely with the cryptographic functionality of a module and does not consider any other security functionality. Where a module’s cryptographic functionality has been validated under FIPS 140, ASD can at its discretion, and in consultation with the vendor, reduce the scope of an ACE.</p>

                    <p>If cryptographic equipment or software implements unapproved protocols, as well as AACPs, it is possible that relatively weak protocols could be configured without a user’s knowledge. In combination with an assumed level of security confidence, this represents a security risk.</p>
                </part>
                <part name="guidance">
                    <p>When configuring cryptographic equipment or software that implements an AACP, organisations can ensure that only AACPs can be used by disabling unapproved protocols (which is preferred) or advising users not to use unapproved protocols via usage policies.</p>

                <part name="guidance">
                    <p>While many AACPs support authentication, organisations should be aware that these authentication mechanisms are not foolproof. To be effective, these mechanisms should also be securely implemented and protected. This can be achieved by providing appropriate private key protection, ensuring the correct management of certificate authentication processes, including certificate revocation checking, and using a legitimate identity registration scheme.</p>

For example, forwarding connections and access privileges, using host-based authentication, and permitting system administrator logins. The configuration settings below are based on OpenSSH.

                    <p>IPsec contains two major protocols, Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). In order to provide a secure Virtual Private Network style connection, both authentication and encryption are needed. AH and ESP can provide authentication for the entire IP packet and the payload respectively. However, ESP is generally preferred for authentication since AH by its nature has network address translation limitations. However, if maximum security is desired at the expense of network address translation functionality, then ESP can be wrapped inside of AH, which will then authenticate the entire IP packet and not just the encrypted payload.</p>

                    <p>Gateways are necessary to control data flows between security domains and prevent unauthorised access from external networks. Given the criticality of gateways in controlling the flow of information between security domains, any failure, particularly at higher classifications, may have serious consequences. As such, robust mechanisms for alerting personnel to situations that may cause cyber security incidents are especially important for gateways.</p>

A CDS may be an integrated appliance or, more commonly, be composed of discrete technologies or sub-systems, with each sub-system consisting of hardware and/or software components.</p>

                    <p>Defining a whitelist of allowed websites and blocking all other websites effectively removes one of the most common data delivery and exfiltration techniques used by an adversary.

                    <p>Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of content reaching a security domain is a key component in ensuring its trustworthiness. It is also essential that content that has been authorised for release from a security domain is not modified (e.g. by the addition or substitution of information). If content passing through a filter contains a form of integrity protection, such as a digital signature, the content filter needs to verify the content’s integrity before allowing it through.
